# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for maguro hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and maguro, hence its name.
